## Our Name:
Our name comes from the word **Tern**, A bird, known for its agility,
which refers to our teams ability to quickly respond to evolving

## Our Project:
The project is a catalogue of celebrity biographies, which will help users understand fame and success while preserving stories that resonate with people. It will capture the lives of influential figures in fields like entertainment, sports, and politics, providing a reliable resource for scholars, journalists, and fans. Celebrities serve as role models, inspiring people and greatly shaping public opinion. A catalogue helps track the influence and relevance of certain figures, providing a deeper understanding of various fields or industries.
