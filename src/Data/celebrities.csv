Albert,Einstein,"March 14, 1879",18 April 1955,src\\Data\\Images\\Albert_Einstein\ryan.png,"Albert Einstein was a German-born theoretical physicist who is best known for developing the theory of relativity. He also made significant contributions to quantum mechanics. His mass-energy equivalence formula E = mc², which comes from special relativity, is considered one of the most famous equations in the world. In 1921, he received the Nobel Prize in Physics for his services to theoretical physics, particularly for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect. Born in the German Empire, Einstein moved to Switzerland in 1895 and gave up his German citizenship the following year. In 1897, at the age of seventeen, he enrolled in the mathematics and physics teaching diploma program at the Swiss Federal Polytechnic School in Zurich, graduating in 1900. He became a Swiss citizen a year later and then took a permanent job at the Swiss Patent Office in Bern. In 1905, he submitted a successful PhD dissertation to the University of Zurich. In 1914, he moved to Berlin to join the Prussian Academy of Sciences and Humboldt University of Berlin, and became the director of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics in 1917. He also regained German citizenship, this time as a subject of the Kingdom of Prussia. In 1933, while Einstein was visiting the United States, Adolf Hitler came to power in Germany. Disturbed by the Nazi persecution of Jews, he decided to remain in the US and was granted American citizenship in 1940. On the brink of World War II, he signed a letter to President Franklin D. Roosevelt warning about the potential German nuclear weapons program and suggesting that the US begin similar research.","General relativity,Special relativity",Physics,Mileva Marić,,,,,,,,male,"$1,000,000"
